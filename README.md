# Events for Spring 2021

This semester, in an effort to increase the quick, hands-on coding opportunities in statistics at Amherst, we will be holding a series of "Tidy Tuesdays." Similar to the popular [tidy tuesday challenge](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) from GitHub, we will be releasing a dataset a little bit in advance to our meeting. During the meeting, we will start or keep working on the challenge or discuss our visualization(s). Check out some of the cool Tidy Tuesday visualizations from Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidytuesday?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag)! There's a lot of cool stuff to learn!

## Thursday Feb 25 5:30-6:30 EST: Tidy Thursday
[Plastic pollution dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-01-26). Check out `plastics.csv` for the dataset. The Readme has some instructions on getting started! Here's the [Zoom link](https://amherstcollege.zoom.us/j/96730741628)
